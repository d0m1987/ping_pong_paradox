Ideas for the future
--------------------
* Points decrease over time the more you move your paddle
* Ball is attracted/distracted to/from your paddle
* Bonuses, e.g. slower ball on your side of the screen or bigger paddle
* Instead of moving a paddle, the whole side is a paddle and you are moving a hole in the wall
* Let the net in the middle move and you need to get through it
